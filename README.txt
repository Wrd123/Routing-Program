Routing-Program

A Python-based program that implements routing logic to simulate how network packets move between nodes. Designed to reinforce understanding of graph algorithms, pathfinding, and networking fundamentals.

Features:

Implements Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm for shortest path routing

Supports multiple nodes and weighted connections

Provides a step-by-step breakdown of path selection

Lightweight CLI interface for testing and learning

Tech Stack:

Language: Python

Concepts: Graphs, Algorithms, Data Structures, Networking Basics

Usage:
#Run the Program 
python routing.py

Purpose:

Built as part of my Computer Science coursework to strengthen knowledge of algorithms and networking, with real-world applicability in systems design and defense technology.
